# cpp-list
CoW functional list in C++11.

Functionality loosely follows all the nice stuff you find in Haskell ([Prelude](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Prelude.html)). Here's a list of functions that have been implemented so far. If the name is different in Haskell, it is given in parentheses.

 * `cons` (:)
 * `makeList` ([...])
 * `append` _does not exist in Haskell..._
 * `join` (++)
 * `apply`
 * `fmap`
 * `foldl`
 * `foldl1`
 * `foldr`
 * `foldr1`
 * `size` (length)
 * `empty` (null)
 * `reverse`
 * `zipWith`

 More functions will follow. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to write an issue report.
